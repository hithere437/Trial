If you are ever reading this this is for you. You didn't understand how much I loved you or you did and still chose to leave for your peace, you did for yourself and I am happy for you but at the same time for me not that much.

It will always be here for you. I hope you will see in someday.

All the good things that I will accomplish in life, partial credit goes to you...

Thank you for everything.
