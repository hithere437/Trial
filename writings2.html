  <p>First of all, thank you for everything. Thank you for all the things that you did for me. I appreciate all of you. I would like you to read this if you can, and when you can.</p>

  <p>Disclaimer: You may not agree with everything here. It is a honest, transparent letter and a bit long, but please don't be overwhelhm.. I hope you read it all. I know you may not like it, but I wanted you to know the truth about why I acted the way I did. This 
    may even ruin the chances if I have any, but this was what the past me lived through. The new me is a better me learning from experience and doing whats right. And I am sorry for every thing that you may disagree with.<br>In short, I have learned from my mistakes. The change is real and for life not just to get you back. Give me a chance.</p>
  
  <p>Now, again I am sorry for everything. I am deeply sorry for ruining your memories. I love you Fatahh.</p>

  <p>I know you don’t want any justification but this letter is a letter of realization. Shraddha you left me because you couldn’t handle me. It’s ok. You left me because you didn’t see the future with the current me and the previous future faded. I accept your choice. (And when I become the one with whom you see your future, you will come back. Even if you think otherwise, don’t ruin it, it has kept me sane.)</p>

  <p>But after you left me, I told myself I put so much effort and still I am left with nothing? This is the answer that I have got now. I loved you truly but I didn’t know how to love. I put efforts in the beginning and thought efforts are the key to sustain relationships. NO. Safety and security are the key to sustain relationships. Assurity is one of the important things to keep a girl's heart calm. I did not have any wrong intentions but I am sorry in the last moment and moments before that I couldn’t give you one, even though I was and am true to you. You said until you get something, you don’t back down, Shraddha I was trying my best to solve that issue, but I am sorry it was not on time.</p>

  <p>I am sorry that I couldn’t love you selflessly. I am sorry I wanted your efforts too in the relationship. I wanted to feel loved like how I loved you, not just words. I am sorry that I drained your energy in me. For me, every moment with you is a blessing. I felt broken when you said you did not want to meet me because I wanted to kiss all the time. And me being angry. Shraddha I am sorry. But kissing you was love to me, it was what I knew teenagers in love would do, at least what I had learned from movies, series and people around me. I am sorry my false belief made me blind to your gestures saying no. And I also realized I have a resting bitch face. I am really sorry.</p>

  <p>I am not giving you any excuses but realizing my mistakes and correcting them for life. Yes, coming to America, my environment changed. My desires started rising with all the things I was seeing. My conversations with friends became narrower. I did not control my desires even though I never acted on them. In the end, it grew so big that I lost you. I realized that I am a lattoo k bhoot. Yes, Shraddha, I asked for some things. I am sorry. It’s not because I am a pervert. It was just that if you loved me, you would send it to me, mindset. That is what I was seeing in my surroundings, and I wanted the same level of validation or assurance. I know it sounds wrong, but that is the truth. I was an immature kid. Shraddha I know some interactions recently, I fully acted like a pervert. Combined that with the last conversations, I know you think I was unfaithful to you. But I want you to know I was (am) always faithful to you. I know I said things I should not have said, nobody wants to hear such things from their partner, but I wanted to make you jealous so you could love me more. I know it sounds shit but I was that immature. I know you are angry again, I am sorry Shraddha.</p>

  <p>Thank you Shraddha I love you more than ever for making me realize what had happened in my brain. For the first time in a long time, I can say I can think clearly about the wrongs and rights. You were my rude cheerleader who always wanted the best of me. I was thinking everything that my friends were saying was right, cause they were there with me, but no I had been thinking wrong.</p>

  <p>Shraddha you won’t like this but there were moments recently when you were angry with what I said or did. I was actually quite happy because I felt that she was angry with what I did (that felt like love to me, again as a validation: an angry girlfriend loves you). With the former feeling dominant, I did not realize how grave the issue was to you. I am really sorry.</p>

  <p>From the beginning I think I was desperate for your love because of your quiet nature, or the fear that she may fall out of love. Yeah there are times when I feel that you really did not respect me enough. Maybe it's because I never made you feel my absence even when I was angry. But it's ok, Shraddha. I had accepted you as you were because I had a feeling with time you would understand me. Yes, I complained a lot about your behaviour but I just wanted to be respected, loved, understood and was impatient for that time.</p>

  <p>In our time together, I never had any wrong intentions with you, but I am sorry I couldn’t control my weak mind that was influenced easily. But I am thankful for making me realize it.</p>

  <p>Hey that's all I know for now. I am really sorry for draining your energy on me. Since that day I have changed a lot. Meditation is cool. You may say then why are you writing this? I am writing this because although all of me changed, my love still hasn’t. The wish to spend time with you while staring at your eyes and you giving that awkward yet beautiful smile is still there. And I couldn’t say anything except sorry in our last conversation. Yes, love may have disappeared for me, but I believe that it will appear again too. (And it's the second series of the book you read.)</p>

  <p>Shraddha I am sorry for everything I did. It's a late realization but better late than never. I want to learn how to love the right way, and I hope you’ll give me a chance to show that. I assure you this investment will be a success. I’ve never given you a false promise, and this one is from my heart — I promise to do everything I can to keep you happy for the rest of your life. But I request you to give this boy a chance. I ask you to tell me everything that is wrong with me that I still haven’t realized yet so I can correct it. This change is real. I understand that love exists in freewill so I don’t wanna beg but still I can express my love so I am expressing.</p>

  <p>Shraddha I realize that I may have even given you some bad experience, that you don’t even wanna think about it. I am sorry. When I say let's get back together, maybe that fear will stop you. Shraddha but I want you to have faith in me. I want you to know that love is one of the strongest energies in the world that has transformed the world and I am just a boy.</p>

  <p>Shraddha we once had a conversation that you would call me always, once you are in Australia. I did not believe you but you backed yourself up by “I call you every time I am alone at home”. I am somewhat in a similar position. You think I haven’t and won’t change but I have. I don’t know how to prove it but, I will just say I have always put efforts to earn your love and I give you my promise. So please text me once…</p>

  <p>No matter if you choose to invest in me or not, I am thankful for you. I have loved you truly even though I did not know how to love. Moving ahead I want you to be happy, and achieve all the things that you ever wanted. Be the best you. I will always cheer for you, and pray for you.</p>

  <p>I love you Fatahh…</p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br>Princess</p>
