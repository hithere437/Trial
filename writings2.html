  <p>First of all, thank you for everything. Thank you for all the things that you did for me. I appreciate all of you. I would like you to read this if you can, and when you can.</p>

    So i had lost:
    hope
    purpose
    direction
    vision
    next step
    belief in me
    confidence
    

    i was
    overwhelm, stressed, insecure, overthinker, comparer, too ungrateful( looking at the bad side of everything)


    i was ignorant with proudness, i was effortful and that made me feel too proud, and at the same time always felt unworthy, when negativity hit me i used to accept it, had no belief that i could change it
    i think that ,its the feeling that i knew what the problem was but still felt paralyzed, with no hope that nth can be changed
    i used to feel guilty with what i had, i hadn't committed anything wrong, i had worked for everything i had with good intention, but still felt like i was guilty 

    problem was: all my thinking, ungratefulness, undeserving, not accepting lifeluck, not accepting the gifts of life.

    i needed:
    a path, a sense of hope, a vision, more importantly clarity in what i think

    i got:
    hope, 
    system to grow and achieve my goals
    a sense of purpose 
    a sense of direction
    a feeling that everything will be alright
    gratefulness to everthing in life
    a system to tackle the negatives in mind
    confident
    belief

    i want:
    a miracle (you back in my life, (me thinking positive)) 

    thank you
    your princess
