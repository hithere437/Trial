       <p>Shraddha Hiee…</p>

  <p>Thank you for everything that you have done for me and I am sorry for hurting you. I am especially sorry for not respecting your boundaries. I will learn from my mistakes and not repeat the same mistakes again.</p>

  <p>Shraddha thank you for making me realize that effort is not the only thing that matters in a relationship. It may matter in the beginning but later it's all about the safety, security and a comfortable space where both partners feel understood while respecting each other's boundaries.</p>

  <p>Shraddha I always loved you with true intentions. But I made mistakes that cannot be taken back. Shraddha you had every right to feel hurt and step back and I respect that. I take full responsibility for my actions.</p>

  <p>Shraddha this is not a justification but a realization. Shraddha I never meant to hurt you any day. But I guess in the recent moments, I was not in the right state to even keep you secure. Shraddha, I am not blaming my surroundings or social media but I have realized that I had a weak mind that was influenced by those sources. I learned what it feels like to lose myself, and I don’t want to repeat that. I am super grateful to you who made me realize that.</p>

  <p>I thank you for all the moments that you shared with me. You are a blessing to my life.</p>

  <p>Shraddha moving ahead I pray for your happiness. And for me to be strong. The path is hard and I know that I will be strong. But Shraddha with you it will be an easier path. So I ask you to stand by me. Thank you</p>

  <p>Thank you for everything..</p>

  <p>I love you Fatah</p>
